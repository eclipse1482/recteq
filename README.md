# Home Assistant Recteq Integration

> This is no longer working for me. Seems the protocol has changed but I don't have the time to work on it any more. Sorry gang.

Custom integration for [recteq][recteq] grills and smokers providing a climate
entity to control the unit and sensor entities for the probes.

## Installation

We recommend you install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) first, then add
<https://github.com/mochman/recteq> as a custom integration repository and
finally, add the integration from there.

Instead, if you prefer the manual route, you could download a copy of the
[latest release][latest] and unpack the contents into into
`config/custom_components/recteq/` on your HA machine. Feeling adventurous?
Using `git clone` in `config/custom_components/` to pull the project from
Github works too.

In either case, you need to restart HS once it's installed. Then you need to
[configure](#configuration) it.

## Configuration

This integration is configured using the UI only; no changes in
`configuration.yaml` are needed. Navigate to **Configuration** &raquo;
**Integrations** and tap the red "+" button in the bottom-right. Search for and
select the "Recteq" entry in the list of available integrations to setup.
You'll get the dialog shown below. Enter the details for your grill and tap
"Submit".

Repeat the process if you have multiple grills to control. _(ps: I'm jealous!)_

See the [wiki](https://github.com/mochman/recteq/wiki) for info in where to get
the IP address, device ID and local key values needed.

The "Force Fahrenheit" option was added for folks who operate HA in Celsius but
cook in Fahrenheit. The climate and sensor entities will report tempeatures in
Fahrenheit rather than converting them to Celsius when this option is set. The
thermostat card will still display °C but the values will actually be °F.

## User Interface

The stock [Thermostat Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/thermostat/)
can be used to present the current state of the recteq when it's on. I like to
hide it and display a button instead when it's off. I use conditionals like
below. The result is shown in the screenshot at that top of this document.

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: climate.smoker
        state: 'off'
    card:
      type: glance
      entities:
        - entity: climate.smoker
          tap_action:
            action: toggle
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: climate.smoker
        state_not: 'off'
    card:
      type: thermostat
      entity: climate.smoker
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: climate.smoker
        state_not: 'off'
      - entity: input_number.smoker_probe_a_target
        state_not: '0.0'
    card:
      type: glance
      entities:
        - entity: sensor.smoker_probe_a_temperature
          name: Probe-A
        - entity: input_number.smoker_probe_a_target
          name: Target
        - entity: sensor.smoker_probe_a_status
          name: Status
      state_color: true
  - type: history-graph
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.smoker_target_temperature
        name: Target
      - entity: sensor.smoker_actual_temperature
        name: Actual
      - entity: sensor.smoker_probe_a_temperature
        name: Probe-A
      - entity: sensor.smoker_probe_b_temperature
        name: Probe-B
    refresh_interval: 0
    hours_to_show: 8
```

The third panel above mimics the logic in the app that monitors the probe. I
created an `input_number` named "Smoker Probe-A Target" (min=0.0, max=500.0,
step=5.0, mode=slider, unit=°F, icon=mdi:thermometer). Then I added the
template sensor below. An automation to send notifications could be added too
if desired.

> **NOTE* - If you're using the "Force Fahrenheit" option, don't set the units
> on the input\_number or HA will try to convert it automagically.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      smoker_probe_a_status:
        value_template: >
          {% if states('climate.smoker') == 'off' or states('sensor.smoker_probe_a_temperature') == 'unavailable' -%}
            undefined
          {% else %}
            {% set target = states('input_number.smoker_probe_a_target')|round %}
            {% set actual = states('sensor.smoker_probe_a_temperature')|round %}
            {% set offset = actual - target %}
            {% if offset > 5 %}Over Temp!
            {% elif offset > -5 %}At Target
            {% elif offset > -15 %}Approaching...
            {% else %}Waiting...{% endif %}
          {%- endif %}
```
